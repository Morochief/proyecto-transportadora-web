- Read `SECURITY_FEATURES.md` for detailed documentation

### 4. Customize (Optional)
- Adjust password policy in `backend/config.py`
- Customize UI colors/styling in CSS files
- Configure session timeouts

### 5. Deploy to Production
- Update CORS settings for production domain
- Enable HTTPS
- Configure secure session cookies
- Set up proper logging

## Known Issues / Notes

### SQLAlchemy Warnings
The backend shows SQLAlchemy relationship warnings on startup. These are harmless and don't affect functionality. They can be silenced by adding `overlaps` parameters to relationships in `backend/app/models.py` if desired.

### CORS Configuration
Backend CORS is configured for:
- `http://localhost:3000`
- `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

Update in `backend/config.py` if using different ports.

### Password Policy
Current settings in `backend/config.py`:
- Min length: 12 characters
- Requires: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters
- History: 5 passwords
- Expiration: 90 days (currently disabled with 0)
